Facial recognition is a field of artificial intelligence and image processing that aims to identify individuals based on their unique facial features. A key technique in this domain is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces data dimensionality while preserving essential facial characteristics. PCA transforms facial images into a lower-dimensional space, capturing the most significant variations. It is widely used in data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing by identifying principal components that explain the highest variance. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with highly correlated variables, enabling efficient feature extraction for facial recognition systems.
